      <p> I am confident and hardworking individual who enjoys using his initiative in all aspect of work. I am reliable, helping people and always loving to learn and grow and I do not give up anything until I get it right. I don't have much experience on programming before bootcamp as the only programming I've done before was using Visual studio in making couple projects back in college. However, I look forward in gaining more knowledge on different programming languages and this has lead me to my first programming project in Bootcamp.</p>

    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
	City (2020). This Processing project demonstrates a thorough understanding 
	of the use of arrays, loops, mouse functions and keyboard functions. I created a bouncing balls in which 
	details of each ball (e.g. position, ball color, speed, size and shape) 
	are stored in parallel arrays. A bouncing ball is added whenever a user clicks inside the window and when a user drags the mouse  multiple balls would be added inside the window, also, there's a "println()" funtion which display the amount of balls inside the window. However, the balls can be controlled using some letters on the keyboard (Keyboard Functions) which are:<br/>"p" - to pause/play the balls.<br/> "r" - to reset the balls in the window.
